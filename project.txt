Final Project – Tokenized Asset Management Platform
⚠️
READ CAREFULLY – you will lose points if you forget or skip parts of the assignment. Every requirement matters.
Objective
You will build a Tokenized Asset Management Platform on either:
● Any EVM-compatible blockchain, or
● The XRP Ledger
-> You must be able to justify your choice (technical decision, users you want to target, etc)
Your platform must allow users to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), manage ownership, and trade tokens securely on-chain.
Group Rules
● You can create groups of 3-4 people
● You are encouraged to discuss, exchange ideas, and even share parts of your code with other groups.
● ❌ However, brutal copy/paste between groups will result in point loss. Each group must demonstrate their own understanding and implementation.
Total estimated workload: ~120–150 hours per group over 5 weeks.
Core Requirements
1. Tokenization of Real-World Assets
● Students must choose a real-world asset or a class of assets (please don’t tokenize Pokemon cards or random objects)
● Platform must support two types of tokenization:
● Fungible tokens (ERC-20 / IoU, MPT XLS33 on XRPL) → e.g. company shares, real estate shares.
● Non-fungible tokens (NFTs, ERC721 / XLS-20) → e.g. unique artwork, collectibles, diamonds.
2. Compliance: On-Chain KYC & Whitelisting/Blacklisting
● Implement a simple KYC system.
● Only whitelisted addresses can hold and/or trade the tokenized assets.
● Include a blacklist mechanism (e.g. revoking access if needed and deny even with KYC).
● Enforce this logic on-chain (not just in the frontend).
3. Token Trading (On-Chain)
● Token must be tradable on-chain.
● Trading allowed only between whitelisted users.
● Create at least one liquidity pool on a DEX (e.g. Uniswap or XRP Ledger built-in AMM).
● Provide initial liquidity yourself (reuse DEX pool code from class).
4. Real-Time On-Chain Awareness (Indexer)
● Your frontend must refl ect the real state of the blockchain.
● If a user swaps directly on the DEX (outside your UI), the change must appear in your app
● Build a simple indexer (runs e.g. every minute) that syncs on-chain events to your app’s backend/frontend.
● (You can reuse the indexer code you built in class).
5. Oracles
● Add an on-chain oracle for at least one token/collection. Example: oracle provides price data for a real-world asset or NFT collection. (You can reuse oracle code from class if needed).
Technical Guidelines
● Blockchain choice: XRP Ledger or any EVM-compatible blockchain (you must be able to justify your choice).
● Onchain logic: Use Solidity (EVM) smart contracts or XRPL primitives.
● Frontend: Just make it clear and intuitive.
● Backend/Indexer: Simple service to query blockchain events and keep the frontend in sync.
● DEX Integration: Uniswap v3/v4 or forks, Sushiswap, or XRPL AMM (depending on your chosen chain).
Allowed Programming languages:
- Javascript / Typescript (recommended because of the very complete and intuitive web3 libraries like ethers, viem, web3, …)
- Rust / Go
- Python
You can use any other programming language but only you asked me and I accepted it
Deliverables
● Fully working platform deployed on chosen chain (testnet only) (Hosting the frontend is mandatory, you can use vercel for free).
● Source code Available in a single github repository (public).
● Documentation (how to use + design choices), a complete README.md fi le can be enough.
● Demo presentation showing tokenization, compliance, trading, oracle, and on-chain syncing.
Bonus Points
● Support Multisig wallets (as protocol admins and/or as users)
● Gas sponsoring (meta-transactions, relayers, erc4337, or any other way)
● Anything you want to do that is not required and is linked with what we studied
Important: The project is not just about coding — documentation, and design matter.

Choix technique:
techno choisi: XRP Ledger (XRPL)
Jetons Non-Fongibles (NFT - ERC721/XLS-20) :
Chaque carte unique d'un jeu de collection (ex: un Tarot de Marseille original du 18ème siècle ou une édition limitée numérotée) est représentée par un NFT. Ce NFT sert de certificat d'authenticité et de propriété.
Jetons Fongibles (ERC-20/IoU) :
Vous permettez la propriété fractionnée d'un jeu de tarot extrêmement cher (ex: le Visconti-Sforza, estimé à des millions d'euros). Les utilisateurs achètent des parts du jeu de tarot complet sous forme de tokens.
